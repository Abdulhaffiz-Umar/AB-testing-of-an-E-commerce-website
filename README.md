## Analyze A/B Test Results

In this project, I showcased my ability to perform A/B tests using data from an e-commerce website. The objective was to determine whether the old page has more interactions than the new page. 


## Methodology
* Part 1: Probability evaluation using python 
* Part 2: A/B test
* PArt 3: Regression analysis 

## Conclusion
* The old page performed better than the new page and this was confirmed using multiple testing techniques.
* Based on the results from the regression analysis, we find hat the p_values for the interaction between the pages and country does not yield enough significance to support the alternative hypothesis.
* Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and affirm that the old page should be kept as it performed slightly better in all the tests.
